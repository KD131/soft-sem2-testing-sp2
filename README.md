## 1. Reflections

### 1.1. Computer Mouse

> Identify the types of testing you would perform on a computer mouse, to make sure that it is of the highest quality.

### 1.2. Catastrophic Failure

> Find a story where a software system defect had a bad outcome. Describe what happened. Can you identify a test that would have prevented it?

## 2. Two Katas

> Complete the following using BDD.

### 2.1. String Utility

> Use BDD to create a string utility with the following methods:
>
> - Reverse string (aBc -> cBa)
> - Capitalize string (aBc -> ABC)
> - Lowercase string (aBc -> abc)
>
> Don’t use any built-in string utility – create your own. Remember, the exercise here is to use BDD, not to deliver a working utility without tests. If there are no tests in the solution, it won’t be accepted.

### 2.2. Bowling Game Kata

> Complete the Bowling Game Kata using BDD. The slides can be found here:  
> <http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt>

## 3. Investigation Of Tools

### 3.1. JUnit 5

> Investigate JUnit 5 (Jupiter). Explain the following, and how they are useful.
>
> - `@Tag`
> - `@Disabled`
> - `@RepeatedTest`
> - `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`
> - `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`
> - `@DisplayName`
> - `@Nested`
> - `assumeFalse`, `assumeTrue`

### 3.2. Mocking Frameworks

> Investigate mocking frameworks for your preferred language. Choose at least two frameworks, and answer the questions. (One could be Mockito, which we saw in class.)
>
> - What are their similarities?
> - What are their differences?
> - Which one would you prefer, if any, and why?
